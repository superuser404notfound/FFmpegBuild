## Why

Full FFmpeg builds for iOS land at 40-70 MB because they bundle a TLS stack, encoders, filters, and a dozen protocols your app will never use. For a player, most of that is dead weight. Apple already ships HTTP/3, `URLSession`, `Network.framework`, VideoToolbox and AVFoundation. So this build strips out everything you don't need and keeps what you do.

**~10 MB per architecture, zero network dependencies, one build script.**

## In

| Library        | What it does                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| libavformat    | Demux MKV, MP4, WebM, MPEG-TS, MPEG-PS (VOB / DVD), HLS, AVI, ASF / WMV, OGG, FLV, plus raw elementary streams (including DTS, TrueHD and LATM AAC) |
| libavcodec     | Decode video + audio (with VideoToolbox bridge)       |
| libavutil      | Shared primitives                                     |
| libswresample  | Audio resampling / channel remap / format convert     |
| libswscale     | Pixel-format convert (YUV → NV12 / P010) for the SW-decode path |
| libavfilter    | Trimmed filter set: zscale + tonemap + colorspace for HDR → SDR still extraction, bwdif + yadif for CPU deinterlacing on the SW-decode path, yadif_videotoolbox + hwupload for GPU (Metal) deinterlacing of VideoToolbox frames |
| **dav1d**      | Fast AV1 software decoder (separate xcframework)      |
| **zimg**       | zscale's resampling / colorspace backend (separate xcframework, link-only) |
| **libzvbi**    | DVB teletext decoder backend for `libzvbi_teletext` (separate xcframework, link-only) |

## Out

Anything the app layer should already handle or doesn't need:

- Network / TLS: FFmpeg reads from an `avio_alloc_context` callback, you wire `URLSession` to it
- Encoders, except FLAC and EAC3 (kept for the audio bridge that re-encodes non-streamable sources like TrueHD / DTS / DTS-HD MA. FLAC for the lossless 7.1 path, EAC3 5.1 for the default soundbar-compat path that surfaces surround via HDMI bitstream tunnel)
- Muxers, except MP4 / MOV / HLS (kept for the HLS-fMP4 producer that wraps streams for AVPlayer)
- libavdevice (libavfilter is included but trimmed to a handful of filters, see In)
- Most filters: libavfilter ships only buffer / buffersink / format / scale / zscale / tonemap / colorspace / bwdif / yadif / yadif_videotoolbox / hwupload
- Programs (`ffmpeg`, `ffplay`, `ffprobe`)
- Hardware accel layers other than VideoToolbox
- Text subtitle rendering (do that in SwiftUI)

## Build

```sh
./build.sh          # all platforms, dynamic frameworks (the shipped shape)
./build.sh static   # static variant, for apps that can meet LGPL 6(a) themselves
./build.sh package  # repackage frameworks without recompiling
./build.sh clean    # wipe everything
```

Needs Xcode 16+ and roughly 10-30 minutes depending on your machine. All sources (FFmpeg, dav1d, zimg, libzvbi) clone on first run.

Output lands in `Sources/` as xcframeworks, ready to consume via Swift Package Manager. The shipped xcframeworks contain **dynamic frameworks** (dylib-in-framework, `@rpath` install names); Xcode embeds and signs them in the app bundle automatically when you link the package. That is what keeps the LGPL relink requirement satisfiable for closed-source apps, see License below.

## Use

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/superuser404notfound/FFmpegBuild", from: "3.6.0")
]

// Target:
.product(name: "AetherFFmpegBuild", package: "FFmpegBuild")
```

Pin `branch: "main"` instead of a version if you want to track the latest rebuilds (that is how [AetherEngine](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine) consumes it).

Then import the modules you need: `AetherLibavformat`, `AetherLibavcodec`, `AetherLibavutil`, `AetherLibswresample`, `AetherLibswscale`, `AetherLibavfilter`, `AetherLibdav1d`. (`AetherLibzimg` is a link-only backend for `zscale`, and `AetherLibzvbi` a link-only backend for the teletext decoder; you don't import either directly.) The umbrella `AetherFFmpegBuild` product links all of them plus the system frameworks (AudioToolbox, CoreMedia, CoreVideo, VideoToolbox) in one shot.

The FFmpeg API itself is unchanged: `avformat_open_input`, `avcodec_send_packet` and the rest keep their names. Only the module and framework names carry the prefix.

## Sitting next to another FFmpeg

Every FFmpeg packaged for Apple platforms declares the same target names, so before 3.0.0 this package could not resolve in an app that also had one. A fallback ladder with KSPlayer, mpv or MobileVLCKit in it is exactly such an app:

```
error: multiple similar targets 'Libavcodec', 'Libavfilter', 'Libavformat' and 3 others
appear in package 'ffmpegbuild' and 'ffmpegkit'
```

`moduleAliases` does not reach this: it renames Swift source targets, not binary ones. Two things had to change, and 3.0.0 changes both:

- **SwiftPM target and product names** are unique across the whole dependency graph. `AetherLibavcodec` no longer meets `Libavcodec`.
- **Framework bundle and install names**, because two `Libavcodec.framework` bundles cannot both live at `App.app/Frameworks/` under one `@rpath/Libavcodec.framework/Libavcodec`. The shipped install name is now `@rpath/AetherLibavcodec.framework/AetherLibavcodec`.

What the rename does **not** change is the C symbols: `_avcodec_open2` is still `_avcodec_open2` in every FFmpeg on earth. Distinct dynamic frameworks are enough on their own, because the two-level namespace records per reference which dylib it came from. A **static** FFmpeg in the same executable is the case that still bites: its symbols become definitions inside the executable and win for every object linked beside them. The fix there is to link the code that calls this build into its own dynamic framework, so its `_av*` bind at that framework's link. AetherEngine documents the recipe in [docs/api.md](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/blob/main/docs/api.md#one-ffmpeg-and-it-has-to-be-the-engines).

## Decoder support

- **Video (hardware via VideoToolbox)**: H.264, HEVC up to Main10 (HDR10 / DV Profile 8)
- **Video (software)**: AV1 (dav1d), VP9, VP8, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, VC-1, QuickTime RLE (qtrle), and the legacy Microsoft tail: MS-MPEG4 v1 / v2 / v3 (DivX 3.x in pre-2005 AVI rips), WMV1 / WMV2, WMV3 (WMV9). A native `.wmv` / `.asf` plays whole: the `asf` demuxer and every WMA decoder ship with it, because a decoder left out is a file with silent audio (the consumer's bridge finds no decoder for the id and the session falls to video-only). The Flash tail is here for the same reason: FLV1 (Sorenson Spark) and On2 VP6 / VP6F / VP6A with the era's audio, so a legacy `.flv` plays whole where before only H.264-in-FLV did. Flash Screen Video stays out, it needs zlib
- **Audio**: AAC, AC3, EAC3 (incl. JOC detection for Atmos), FLAC, MP2, MP3, Opus, Vorbis, TrueHD, MLP, DTS, ALAC, PCM (incl. Blu-ray LPCM via `pcm_bluray`, G.711 A-law / mu-law, big-endian and unsigned 8-bit), WMA Standard / Pro / Lossless / Voice, Nellymoser Asao, ADPCM-SWF, Speex
- **Subtitles**: SRT, ASS, SSA, WebVTT, PGS, DVB subtitle, DVB teletext (via libzvbi), DVD

HDR metadata (BT.2020, SMPTE ST 2084 / PQ, HLG, DV RPU) is preserved end-to-end so the decode pipeline can tag frames correctly.

## Size

Release configuration, dynamic framework binaries as embedded in the app (all six FFmpeg libraries plus the dav1d, zimg and zvbi backend frameworks):

| Target                            | FFmpeg    | dav1d    | zimg     | zvbi     | Total     |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| iOS / tvOS / visionOS arm64       | ~8.7 MB   | ~0.8 MB  | ~0.3 MB  | ~0.5 MB  | ~10.5 MB  |
| macOS universal (arm64 + x86_64)  | ~18.3 MB  | ~2.5 MB  | ~0.9 MB  | ~1.0 MB  | ~22.7 MB  |

Assembly-optimized paths are enabled where the Apple toolchain permits.

The dSYMs below add roughly 45 MB to a checkout of this package and nothing at all to your app: they are not embedded, Xcode moves them into the archive.

## Crash symbolication

Every slice a shipped app can embed (iOS, tvOS and visionOS device, macOS) carries its dSYM inside the xcframework. Xcode copies it into `.xcarchive/dSYMs` when it embeds the framework, so a crash inside FFmpeg symbolicates in the Organizer, and App Store Connect stops answering an upload with "The archive did not include a dSYM for Libavcodec.framework with the UUIDs [...]". Nothing to do on your side.

The libraries compile with `-gline-tables-only`: function names, file and line, and inlined frames, which is what a crash report resolves against, without the type information that makes up the bulk of full `-g` DWARF. Generated code is unchanged and the shipped binaries are still stripped; the debug information lives in the dSYM only.

Simulator slices ship without dSYMs deliberately. They reach neither an archive nor a user's crash report, and they would put another 45 MB of binaries into every clone. `./build.sh` writes theirs to `build/dsyms` if you want them locally.

Symbols and binaries are a pair per build. A dSYM from one release symbolicates nothing in an app that shipped another, because the UUIDs differ, and releases before 3.3.0 have no dSYMs at all: the debug information was never compiled in, so it cannot be produced for them after the fact.

## Local FFmpeg patches

`build.sh` applies seven small patches to the FFmpeg source after checkout (each documented in place):

- **`patch_ffmpeg`**: balances autoreleased Metal objects in `vf_yadif_videotoolbox.m` (upstream over-release crashes host apps whose GCD queues pop their last-resort autorelease pool at session teardown).
- **`patch_ffmpeg_pgssub`**: `pgssubdec.c` emits an empty (clearing) subtitle instead of dropping a display set whose palette is missing, outside `AV_EF_EXPLODE`. PGS carries no end time, a cue is closed by the start of its successor, so dropping a damaged set also dropped the successor that closes the previous cue, and the predecessor overstayed its authored end until the next intact set arrived (AetherEngine issue 142). The pts is already set and no rect is allocated at that point, so this is the same clearing form the `object_count == 0` path returns. The first version of this patch instead kept the palette/object cache across an Epoch-Continue PCS; that was withdrawn because retained objects occupy the fixed `MAX_EPOCH_OBJECTS` slots and made a conformant connection set fail with "Too many objects in epoch". Proposed upstream as FFmpeg PR 23851.
- **`patch_ffmpeg_visionos`**: `videotoolbox.c` skips `kCVPixelBufferOpenGLESCompatibilityKey` on visionOS, where the key is unavailable because the platform has neither OpenGL ES nor OpenGL. Upstream selects it on `TARGET_OS_IPHONE`, which is 1 on visionOS (`TARGET_OS_IOS` is the one that is 0), so the hardware-decode path does not compile for `xros` without this. Nothing is lost: the attribute only asks CoreVideo to make the buffer bindable as a GL texture, and on visionOS every consumer is Metal, which the IOSurface properties set alongside it already cover.
- **`patch_ffmpeg_vc1_parser`**: `vc1_parser.c` seeds its parse context from `avctx->extradata` the way `vc1_decode_init` does. libavformat closes and reopens the parser on every reposition, so without this a seek lands on a zeroed `VC1Context` and the entry point BDU that follows is read at the wrong bit offset: `hrd_full[]` precedes `coded_size_flag` only when the sequence header set `hrd_param_flag`, which a zeroed context cannot know. The bit taken for `coded_size_flag` is then the leaky bucket fullness at that entry point, so a bucket below half falls back to a zero picture size ("Picture size 0x0 is invalid") and one above half takes a coded size out of the following payload, silently. Affects any VC-1 track whose encoder leaves the sequence header to the container (AetherEngine issue 490). Proposed upstream as FFmpeg PR 24458.
- **`patch_ffmpeg_dav1_tag`**: `isom_tags.c` and `movenc.c` learn the `dav1` sample entry, the AV1 variant of `av01` that MP4RA registers for Dolby Vision. Apple's HLS authoring spec requires it for Dolby Vision Profile 10.0, the AV1 analogue of HEVC Profile 5: an IPT-PQ-c2 signal with no compatible base layer, so `av01` is not an alternative there. FFmpeg carries the tag in neither direction, and both tables matter: without the `isom_tags.c` entry a `dav1` MP4 probes as "unknown codec", and without the `codec_mp4_tags` entry in `movenc.c` `validate_codec_tag()` rejects the requested tag and `avformat_write_header` fails with EINVAL, so a remux never starts. `dvh1` already sits in that second table, which is why the HEVC Profile 5 route works. The cross-compatible profiles (10.1 / 10.4) ride an `av01` sample entry with SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS and are unaffected (AetherEngine issue 547).
- **`patch_ffmpeg_mpegts_mpeg1_probe`**: `mpegts.c` probes the payload of a PID labelled 0x03 (MPEG-1 audio), as it already does for 0x04 (MPEG-2 audio) and 0x0f (AAC). Upstream takes 0x03 at its word, so a restreamer that labels a DTS PID that way opens it as mp3, every packet fails with "Header missing", and the track never produces a frame (AetherEngine issue 641). A genuine MP2 or MP3 PID settles on its first PES packet, and a probe that finds nothing better keeps the PMT's codec. The same issue is why the raw `dts`, `truehd` and `loas` demuxers are enabled: the MPEG-TS content probe confirms a codec by running the raw demuxers' probes over the payload, so a codec without its raw demuxer in the build could never be confirmed, and the lenient mp3 probe named the track instead, whatever the label.
- **`patch_ffmpeg_matroska_tts`**: `matroskadec.c` logs a warning when a Matroska track carries a `TrackTimestampScale` other than 1.0. Timestamp behavior stays exactly as upstream implements it, which is what RFC 9559 specifies (block timestamps and BlockDuration are Track Ticks). The element is deprecated (maxver 3) and many readers ignore it, so a file carrying it may have been authored against such readers and mistime silently; the warning surfaces that condition (AetherEngine issue 145). Until 2.1.x this patch clamped TTS to 1.0; the clamp rested on a wrong reading of the RFC and was dropped after upstream review (FFmpeg PR 23852).

## Keeping the pins current

The versions this package builds are shell variables in `build.sh`, not a manifest, so no dependency bot sees them. `Scripts/check-upstream.py` compares all five (FFmpeg, dav1d, zimg, libzvbi, and `dolby_vision` over in [LibDovi](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/LibDovi)) against what upstream has published:

```bash
python3 Scripts/check-upstream.py --libdovi ../LibDovi/build.sh
```

It exits 1 when something is behind and prints why, with any published security advisory for that project attached as context. FFmpeg is compared against the newest patch on the pinned minor line rather than the newest tag overall: moving off `8.1` is a deliberate decision, not a weekly reminder.

The [Upstream watch](.github/workflows/upstream-watch.yml) workflow runs it every Monday and keeps exactly one issue: opened when a pin falls behind, rewritten while it stays behind, and closed by the run that finds everything current again. Nothing is posted when there is nothing to do.

## Built with

This package is vibe-coded, assembled and maintained by [Vincent Herbst](https://github.com/superuser404notfound) in close pair-programming with **Claude** (Anthropic). The commit log is the receipt: nearly every commit carries a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

## License

**LGPL-2.1-or-later** ([LICENSE](LICENSE)), matching upstream FFmpeg's default license. The build enables neither `--enable-gpl` nor `--enable-version3`, so no GPL or LGPL-3.0 components are compiled in. Per component:

| Component | License |
| --- | --- |
| FFmpeg (all six libraries) | LGPL-2.1-or-later |
| dav1d | BSD-2-Clause |
| zimg | WTFPL |
| libzvbi (library sources) | LGPL-2.0-or-later, `ure.c` MIT |
| Build scripts / SPM stubs (this repo) | LGPL-2.1-or-later |

libzvbi's three GPL-2 source files (`packet-830.c`, `pdc.c`, `exp-vtx.c`) are **excluded from the build** and the two referenced entry points are replaced with LGPL stubs (`build.sh`, `patch_zvbi`), so the shipped binaries contain no GPL code. All license texts live in [LICENSES/](LICENSES/).

### Shipping in an App Store app

The xcframeworks are dynamic frameworks on purpose: LGPL section 6 requires that end users can swap in a modified version of the library. With dynamic linking your app binary stays yours (closed source is fine) and the obligations reduce to:

1. Link the package normally; Xcode embeds the frameworks in `YourApp.app/Frameworks/`. Do not merge them into the app binary (no mergeable-library trickery), that would recreate static linking.
2. Reproduce the license texts from [LICENSES/](LICENSES/) somewhere reasonable (acknowledgements screen, bundled file).
3. State that your app uses FFmpeg and friends, and link to the source of the exact build you ship (a tagged release of this repo, or your fork if you modified it).

If you build the `static` variant instead, those steps are not sufficient: LGPL 6(a) then requires you to provide your app's object files (or full source) so users can relink. That is realistic for open-source apps and rarely anything else, which is why static is not the shipped shape.
